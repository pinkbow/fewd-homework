This is looking good! You're definitely getting the hang of this.

For the background images, instead of setting the background-size to 100%, you can use:
background-size: cover;
Cover is great to use because it makes the image always completely fill its div (both width and height), even if it has to crop a bit of it off to fit. Try resizing your browser and see what happens with both 100% and cover.

To make that blockquote not stretch across the whole page, you can give it a width, and then center it:
.second_paragraph {
  width: 50%;
  margin: 0 auto;
}

This is a little thing, but for readability, it's better to indent your <li>s, since they are children of the <ul>:
    <ul>
      <li>Schedule meetings for you</li>
      <li>Excel automation to complete your work for you</li>
      <li>Responds to emails on your behalf</li>
      <li>Does all your work for you with our revolutionary AI technology</li>
    </ul>

Overall, this looks really good. Let me know if you have any questions.

Oh, I just realized, you have 2 HW repos, and the one I have push access to is not the one your HW is in. I'll go ahead and just add the feedback to your empty HW repo, but when you get the chance, could you give Seth and me access to your active homework repo? It's under Settings. Thanks.
